# JavaScript30 - Day 26: Stripe Follow Along Nav

This project is part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos, where participants build 30 different projects in 30 days. Day 26 focuses on creating a Stripe-like follow-along navigation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description

In this project, we'll be creating a navigation menu with a follow-along animation similar to the one seen on the Stripe website. The navigation menu will highlight and expand as the user hovers over each menu item, creating a visually appealing and interactive experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project.

## Project Features

- Follow-along animation on navigation menu items.
- Smooth transition effects on hover.
- Dynamic sizing and positioning of the follow-along element.

## How it Works

The project uses event listeners to track mouse movements and hover events on the navigation menu items. When a user hovers over a menu item, the follow-along element is dynamically positioned and resized to match the hovered item's position and dimensions. This creates the effect of the follow-along element smoothly transitioning and expanding to the hovered item.
